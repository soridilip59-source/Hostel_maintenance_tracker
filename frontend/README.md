# React + Vite

## Google Login setup

1. In Google Cloud Console, create a Web OAuth client ID and add your frontend origin to **Authorized JavaScript origins** (for local development: `http://localhost:5173`).
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` to that client ID.
3. Set the same client ID as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in `backend/.env`.
4. Restart both the Vite frontend and Express backend.

Google sign-in credentials are verified by the backend before the application JWT is issued. New Google accounts are created as students; existing users keep their existing role.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
